# Introduction

<h3>The program is an anonymous chat software.</h3>

Considering that different machines use different versions of java and gradle. We don't want to fight with the runtime environment. So, we only uploaded the folder containing the java files and the fxml files. To run this program the steps are more complicated, please follow the bootstrap steps to run the program.

<h5> Bulid tools </h5>

- Gradle

<h5>The following functions are implemented:</h5>

- Multi-client socket
- Sending direct messages to online user
- Save chat record to local file
